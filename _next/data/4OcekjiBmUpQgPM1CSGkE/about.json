I'm a software engineer\nby trade and a nerd by choice, born, raised and also living in Germany, close to Frankfurt. I'm\nprobably best known for being the creator and maintainer of [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org),\na web interface and print server for 3d printers.\n\nI know that a lot of people wonder how to pronounce my last name, so let's get this out\nof the way first. Here's the IPA transcript: `[d íiÀêna h…î ès…°…ô]`.\nAnd since I'm aware that that was probably too nerdy, [here's also a video of me saying it](https://twitter.com/foosel/status/1316753643077611520).\nEven though it may seem like it (and confuses a lot of people), no, that \"√ü\"\nthere is in fact not even remotely related to a B but is rather pronounced like a very sharp s --\nit's called an Eszett and has a [quite interesting backstory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F).\n\nI went to the Technical University of Darmstadt, from which I graduated with a diploma in computer\nscience[^1] in 2007. I was a software architect/IT consultant for a large\ncorporation for a couple years, but since 2014 I've been working full time on my Open Source project\n[OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org) which I created back in late 2012. And since 2016 now I've actually been in\nthe awesome situation to see my work get funded 100% by the community -- if you happen to be a fan of my work\non OctoPrint and want to help fund it as well, [please take a look here](https://support.octoprint.org).\n\nIn my spare time I love playing (and sometimes [streaming](http://twitch.tv/thefoosel)) video\ngames[^2],\nbinging various tv shows[^3], cooking &\nbaking[^4] and tinkering with electronics. Sometimes I even find the time\nto use my various 3d printers. And I also try to improve my photography skills -- btw,\nhere's [my Instagram profile](https://instagram.com/thefoosel).\nWhen there is no pandemic going on I also try to get better at rock climbing at the boulder gym, go to\nthe movies, or play board games or p&p rpgs with friends.\n\nThanks to my open source work I've had quite a number of opportunities to hold talks, give interviews or take part\nin streams and podcasts.
