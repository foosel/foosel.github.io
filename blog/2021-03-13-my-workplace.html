I can&#x27;t stress enough what a difference it can make to just stand for a while during your work day. Exclusively standing should definitely also be avoided (I&#x27;ve had to do this recently for a couple of days because my back would <em>not</em> take sitting for an answer anymore, and it did a bit of a number on my ankles and knees), but regularly switching between sitting and standing is a great way not only to keep your posture intact but also to just get back your concentration.

Imagine a stool, but instead of being stable it has a rounded base that makes it constantly wobble around. You cannot easily slouch on that, you&#x27;ll fall over. Mine can be height adjusted from 61 to 82cm, so I use it both while standing as a small break, but also while sitting.

The stands usually included with monitors tend to not offer enough flexibility to truly dial in the position of the screen in my experience, and this also managed to free up a <em>ton</em> of desktop real estate that I can now utilize. In my case, a wallmount is not an option due to the standing desk situation, so I instead went for a desk mount. A gas lift is not the most stable option in my experience: things can be a bit shaky when I accidentally bump against the desk due to the rather extreme lever position I had to chose to make things work in my office, but it has been working just fine now since 2012. Still, at some point I might get something a bit more static.

A gas lift is not the most stable option in my experience: things can be a bit shaky when I accidentally bump against the desk due to the rather extreme lever position I had to chose to make things work in my office, but it has been working just fine now since 2012. Still, at some point I might get something a bit more static. In any case, a monitor mount is something I\u0026#x27;d highly recommended for everyone really, even if you don\u0026#x27;t want if for ergonomic reasons -- I cannot emphasize the increase in desk space enough ;)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg pathname=\"/blog/2021-03-13-my-workplace\" src=\"/assets/content/blog/2021-03-13-my-workplace/monitors.jpg\" alt=\"My monitors, mounted on a gas lift mount\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003etl;dr\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet a split ergo keyboard, a gaming mouse for your primary and a trackball for your off hand.
