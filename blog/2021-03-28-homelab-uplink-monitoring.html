This is easily queried by Grafana and looks quite nice when visualized:</p><p><img pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" src="/assets/content/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/smokeping.png" alt="A graph showing min, avg and max latency and packet loss data for 8.8.8.8"/></p><p>And on my network dashboard, I plot only the <code>avg</code> values across all hosts and a mean <code>loss</code> value into one single graph each for external and internal hosts:</p><p><img pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" src="/assets/content/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/latency.png" alt="A graph showing avg latency and packet loss data for all remote hosts"/></p><p>This allows me a good overview of the current state of uplink and internal network at one glance.</p><h2>Alerts</h2><p>Since just graphs won&#x27;t give me an immediate heads-up when something goes wrong, I have a bunch of alerts set up in Grafana:</p><ul><li>Measured download speed falls beneath 250MBit for more than one hour</li><li>Measured upload speed falls beneath 35MBit for more than one hour</li><li>Mean packet loss across all external hosts rises above 25% for more than ten minutes</li></ul><p>All of those trigger a notification to a private Discord server (via Grafana&#x27;s own notification mechanism). In theory this notification should even include a screenshot of the panel for which the alert was triggered for, but I&#x27;m having some problems with that still that I need to investigate.</p><p><img pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" src="/assets/content/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/discord.png" alt="An example alert and alert clearance notification in Discord"/></p><p>This notification channel has an obvious problem: When the uplink goes out completely, I won&#x27;t get the notification if my phone is in my LAN. I really need to add a local alert as well at some point 😅</p><p>Still, it usually will give me a heads-up in time for me to reach out to my ISP on short notice and request they start troubleshooting.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This monitoring setup has proven valuable in debugging network performance issues and also getting an early heads-up about current ISP issues. I have successfully used screenshots for proving ongoing issues to my ISP, and also sped up the one or other troubleshooting session when there was in fact an issue with my LAN. In my book, that makes it absolutely worth the time it took me to set this up and maintain it. And: it kinda looks cool 😎</p><p>If you want to give this a go yourself, this might be of interest to you:</p><ul><li><a pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" href="https://gist.github.com/foosel/f7d9a08c0445454ab90d6c4974a9e316">Dockerfile, compose and instructions for speedtest container</a><ul><li><a pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" href="https://gist.github.com/foosel/70ecbeade55cc852dbc0a4f7c4040adc">Ookla speedtest based version</a></li><li><a pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" href="https://gist.github.com/foosel/ef98a5774d1a495ab3781eba8a157fee">speedtest-rs based version</a></li></ul></li><li><a pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" href="https://gist.github.com/foosel/46804306d510d79f14117f95ed64b877">Dockerfile, compose and instructions for infping container</a></li><li><a pathname="/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring" href="https://gist.github.com/foosel/ec0b6355d1d0c3ab65ee4df79d795a73">Panel JSON for the mentioned visualizations</a></li></ul></div></article><p class="flex flex-row mt-6 text-inherit text-sm"><a href="/blog/2021-05-09-a-debugging-story">← A debugging story</a><span class="flex-1"></span><a href="/blog/2021-03-19-on-wrong-assumptions">On wrong assumptions →</a></p></div></div></main><footer class="p-4 bg-black text-white"><div class="max-w-screen-sm xl:max-w-screen-md mx-auto flex flex-col"><p class="text-white text-center">Made with ❤ by<!-- --> <a href="/about">Gina Häußge</a></p><p class="text-white text-center"><a href="/legal">Legal Notice</a> ·<!-- --> <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> ·<!-- --> <a href="/feed/blog.atom">Feed</a></p></div></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring","updated":"2021-03-31T12:40:00+0200","title":"Homelab uplink monitoring","subtitle":"Keeping an eye on my ISP's performance","image":{"url":"/assets/content/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/title.png","alt":"My networking dashboard in Grafana with speed and latency monitoring","external":"https://foosel.net/assets/content/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/title.png"},"content":"\nFor a bit more than two years now I've been closely monitoring my network uplink.

You can find everything needed to run this on your own [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/foosel/46804306d510d79f14117f95ed64b877).\n\nAs a result I get ping output for all hosts every 60 sec with times and packet loss information pushed right into InfluxDB. This is easily queried by Grafana and looks quite nice when visualized:\n\n![A graph showing min, avg and max latency and packet loss data for 8.8.8.8](./smokeping.png)\n\nAnd on my network dashboard, I plot only the `avg` values across all hosts and a mean `loss` value into one single graph each for external and internal hosts:\n\n![A graph showing avg latency and packet loss data for all remote hosts](./latency.png)\n\nThis allows me a good overview of the current state of uplink and internal network at one glance.\n\n## Alerts\n\nSince just graphs won't give me an immediate heads-up when something goes wrong, I have a bunch of alerts set up in Grafana:\n\n-   Measured download speed falls beneath 250MBit for more than one hour\n-   Measured upload speed falls beneath 35MBit for more than one hour\n-   Mean packet loss across all external hosts rises above 25% for more than ten minutes\n\nAll of those trigger a notification to a private Discord server (via Grafana's own notification mechanism). In theory this notification should even include a screenshot of the panel for which the alert was triggered for, but I'm having some problems with that still that I need to investigate.\n\n![An example alert and alert clearance notification in Discord](./discord.png)\n\nThis notification channel has an obvious problem: When the uplink goes out completely, I won't get the notification if my phone is in my LAN. I really need to add a local alert as well at some point 😅\n\nStill, it usually will give me a heads-up in time for me to reach out to my ISP on short notice and request they start troubleshooting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis monitoring setup has proven valuable in debugging network performance issues and also getting an early heads-up about current ISP issues. I have successfully used screenshots for proving ongoing issues to my ISP, and also sped up the one or other troubleshooting session when there was in fact an issue with my LAN. In my book, that makes it absolutely worth the time it took me to set this up and maintain it. And: it kinda looks cool 😎\n\nIf you want to give this a go yourself, this might be of interest to you:\n\n-   [Dockerfile, compose and instructions for speedtest container](https://gist.github.com/foosel/f7d9a08c0445454ab90d6c4974a9e316)\n    -   [Ookla speedtest based version](https://gist.github.com/foosel/70ecbeade55cc852dbc0a4f7c4040adc)\n    -   [speedtest-rs based version](https://gist.github.com/foosel/ef98a5774d1a495ab3781eba8a157fee)\n-   [Dockerfile, compose and instructions for infping container](https://gist.github.com/foosel/46804306d510d79f14117f95ed64b877)\n-   [Panel JSON for the mentioned visualizations](https://gist.github.com/foosel/ec0b6355d1d0c3ab65ee4df79d795a73)\n","assets":[{"slug":"2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring","asset":"bandwidth.png","path":"/home/runner/work/foosel.github.io/foosel.github.io/content/posts/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/bandwidth.png"},{"slug":"2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring","asset":"currentspeed.png","path":"/home/runner/work/foosel.github.io/foosel.github.io/content/posts/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/currentspeed.png"},{"slug":"2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring","asset":"discord.png","path":"/home/runner/work/foosel.github.io/foosel.github.io/content/posts/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/discord.png"},{"slug":"2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring","asset":"latency.png","path":"/home/runner/work/foosel.github.io/foosel.github.io/content/posts/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/latency.png"},{"slug":"2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring","asset":"smokeping.png","path":"/home/runner/work/foosel.github.io/foosel.github.io/content/posts/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/smokeping.png"},{"slug":"2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring","asset":"title.png","path":"/home/runner/work/foosel.github.io/foosel.github.io/content/posts/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring/title.png"}],"published":"2021-03-28T00:00:00Z","readingtime":{"text":"8 min read","minutes":7.11,"time":426600,"words":1422},"mdx":{"compiledSource":"\"use strict\";\n\nvar _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i \u003c arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i \u003c sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) \u003e= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i \u003c sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) \u003e= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar layoutProps = {};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\n\nfunction MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For a bit more than two years now I've been closely monitoring my network uplink.

In particular, \u003ccode\u003espeedtest-cli\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003espeedtest-rs\u003c/code\u003e tests with what Ookla calls the \u003ca pathname=\"/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring\" href=\"http://www.ookla.com/support/a84541858\"\u003e\u0026quot;HTTP Legacy Fallback\u0026quot;\u003c/a\u003e for hosts that cannot establish a direct TCP connection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI fear I might have to look into reimplementing the current speedtest-to-mqtt setup with another container utilizing the official (and sadly proprietary) Speedtest CLI tool to mitigate this issue. Thankfully, it should be quite easy to build a drop-in replacement thanks to the modularization in effect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eUpdate from March 30th 2021\u003c/em\u003e I\u0026#x27;ve now done that and \u003ca pathname=\"/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/foosel/70ecbeade55cc852dbc0a4f7c4040adc\"\u003ehere\u0026#x27;s an updated gist\u003c/a\u003e that works identically to the \u003ccode\u003espeedtest-rs\u003c/code\u003e approach, but instead utilizes \u003ca pathname=\"/blog/2021-03-28-homelab-uplink-monitoring\" href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli\"\u003eOokla\u0026#x27;s official command line tool\u003c/a\u003e.

You might want to experiment a bit to find a server close to you and define that via \u003ccode\u003e--server \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e, the auto discovery appears to be a bit wonky. Or just use your own server list via \u003ccode\u003e--server-json\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003e--local-json\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLatency and packet loss\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the available up- and downstream speeds, I constantly monitor latency and packet loss to a selected number of hosts both external and internal to my network as well. For this I ping some public DNS servers (Google, Cloudflare and Quadnine) and some of my own vservers for the remote side, and the ISP\u0026#x27;s Fritzbox, my managed network gear and internal servers for the LAN side.
