What was meant as an experiment has since become a full blown pepper growing operation that has taken over my livingroom window sills and half the balcony and already yielded its first fruits. And because whenever I try something new I also tend to do way too much research on it, while getting the plants started the normal way in soil (and then promptly running into the first issues with fungus gnats) I started to look deeper into <a pathname="/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics">hydroponics</a>. </p><p>I had heard of this approach before: growing plants in an inert grow medium instead of soil and feeding them with controlled nutrient solutions pumped around the roots. It&#x27;s a fascinating rabbit hole to go down and it always tickled my interest (especially given the automation and sensoric evaluation possibilities), however it also felt way too involved to get started with unless I had some more actual space and some actual need to grow plants, what with all the lights and pumps and pipe systems that I saw associated with it. That is, until I came across the <a pathname="/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratky_method">Kratky method</a>.</p><p>The Kratky method is a pretty much passive approach to hydroponics. The idea is simple: you take an opaque container for your nutrient solution, cut a bunch of holes in the lid and then place your plants into netpots or similar in those holes so their roots reach into the solution. So far, so similar to the <a pathname="/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_water_culture">Deep Water Culture</a> approach. But instead of now aerating the solution with an aquarium air stone or similar to give your roots the oxygen they need, you instead simply allow the level of your nutrient solution to drop, creating an air gap and leaving parts of the roots hanging in the air. That way the roots can get nutrients but can also breathe (which is important so they don&#x27;t rot). You&#x27;ll have to fill up the solution a bit if needed (always leaving an airgap), but apart from that the whole setup is completely self managed. No power needed, no moving parts. And easily set up in something as small as a mason jar.</p><p>This was intriguing to me, and I had wanted to try my luck with growing some basil and oregano for pizza and such anyhow, so I decided to give this approach a shot. I ordered a kitchen herb seed kit, some 1l mason jars, some rock wool cubes (as growing substrate) and some hydroponic fertilizer. Then I fired up FreeCAD and designed a small lid with integrated rock wool cube holder (STL <a pathname="/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way" href="https://foosel.net/files/kratky/quattro_stagioni_kratky_1l_36mm.v2.stl">here</a>, FreeCAD file <a pathname="/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way" href="https://foosel.net/files/kratky/quattro_stagioni_kratky_1l.FCStd">here</a>), printed a bunch of them and then went to work.</p><p><img pathname="/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way" src="/assets/content/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way/lid-design.png" alt="The lid design with rock wool cube holder in FreeCAD"/></p><p>The seeds were planted in the rock wool cubes, watered and then I waited. The first green soon showed up and thus I transferred the cubes into their holders, filled the jars with 1l water plus the recommended fertilizer amount (thus creating a nutrient solution) and then put the lids on. The cubes sat right in the solution and thus were kept watered. To keep light out of the container (to prevent algae growth and also to not have everything heat up so much) I simply wrapped some aluminium foil around the jars. If I&#x27;m honest this was just meant as a temporary solution until I got around to sewing a little cover out of some light blocking fabric I have on hand, but I still haven&#x27;t gotten around to do that and the foil works just fine 🤷‍♀️</p><p><img pathname="/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way" src="/assets/content/blog/2021-09-12-hydroponics-the-kratky-way/start.jpg" alt="The two baby Basil plants at the start of their Krakty journey"/></p><p>That was on July 18th and since then I&#x27;ve been able to witness some astonishing growth, especially on the Basil.
