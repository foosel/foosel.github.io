üëã Hi there!

My name is Gina H√§u√üge, but I also answer to my nickname foosel. I'm a software engineer
by trade and a nerd by choice, born, raised and also living in Germany, close to Frankfurt. I'm
probably best known for being the creator and maintainer of [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org),
a web interface and print server for 3d printers.

I know that a lot of people wonder how to pronounce my last name, so let's get this out
of the way first. Here's the IPA transcript: `[d íiÀêna h…î ès…°…ô]`.
And since I'm aware that that was probably too nerdy, [here's also a video of me saying it](https://twitter.com/foosel/status/1316753643077611520).
Even though it may seem like it (and confuses a lot of people), no, that "√ü"
there is in fact not even remotely related to a B but is rather pronounced like a very sharp s --
it's called an Eszett and has a [quite interesting backstory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F).

I went to the Technical University of Darmstadt, from which I graduated with a diploma in computer
science[^1] in 2007. I was a software architect/IT consultant for a large
corporation for a couple years, but since 2014 I've been working full time on my Open Source project
[OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org) which I created back in late 2012. And since 2016 now I've actually been in
the awesome situation to see my work get funded 100% by the community -- if you happen to be a fan of my work
on OctoPrint and want to help fund it as well, [please take a look here](https://support.octoprint.org).

In my spare time I love playing (and sometimes [streaming](http://twitch.tv/thefoosel)) video
games[^2],
binging various tv shows[^3], cooking &
baking[^4] and tinkering with electronics. Sometimes I even find the time
to use my various 3d printers. And I also try to improve my photography skills -- btw,
here's [my Instagram profile](https://instagram.com/thefoosel).
When there is no pandemic going on I also try to get better at rock climbing at the boulder gym, go to
the movies, or play board games or p&p rpgs with friends.

Thanks to my open source work I've had quite a number of opportunities to hold talks, give interviews or take part
in streams and podcasts. You can find a growing collection of these [here](/media).

[^1]: I took a special interest in software engineering and decided on psychology as my minor field of study.
[^2]: Some favourites include Mass Effect, XCOM, Subnautica, Zelda and Monkey Island.
[^3]: The Expanse is one of my recent favourites.
[^4]: I got into baking bread around early 2019 and actually found _less_ time for it during the pandemic, go figure.
