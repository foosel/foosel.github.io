I recently did a software update on my laptop running Fedora 38, and that also brought in a kernel update. Starting my Win10 VirtualBox VM afterwards no longer worked as it needed the kernel module to be recompiled. However, that failed:

```
$ sudo /sbin/vboxconfig 
[sudo] password for gina: 
vboxdrv.sh: Stopping VirtualBox services.

There were problems setting up VirtualBox.  To re-start the set-up process, run
  /sbin/vboxconfig
as root.  If your system is using EFI Secure Boot you may need to sign the
kernel modules (vboxdrv, vboxnetflt, vboxnetadp, vboxpci) before you can load
them. Please see your Linux system's documentation for more information.
```

A look into `/var/log/vbox-setup.log` revealed an error along the lines of this one[^1]:

```

I did some web searching and came across [this post on the Fedora forums](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/87492) with someone having the exact same issue, and found [a solution in the comments courtesy of Peter Francis](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/6-4-10-200-fc38-x86-64-created-problems-with-virtual-box/87492/12):

And what can I say, it also fixed it for me! And should this not get fixed in the next update, now I'll know where to find the solution again - my own TIL post ðŸ˜‰

PS: Something tells me this won't be the last VirtualBox related TIL post I'll write...

[^1]: This is copy-pasted from someone else, as my log file got overwritten by the successful compile later. However it looked very much like this error, apart from my Kernel already being at 6.4.13.
