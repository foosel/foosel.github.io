Hi! So you are interested in me speaking at your event! Great!

Before we continue in clarifying my availability and hammering out the details by [email](mailto:gina@foosel.net), let me tell you about some minimal requirements I have for speaking engagements:

1. **Health guidelines**: I'm a signatory of the [Public Health Pledge](https://phpledge.com/) and have thus pledged to only speak at or otherwise participate in in-person events that have guidelines in place tailored towards limiting the spread of transmittable diseases like COVID-19 among their visitors. You can find suggestions on how to go about that for your event on the page of the Public Health Pledge.

2. **Code of Conduct**: I will only attend your event if you have a Code of Conduct in place and are able to enforce it.

3. **Speaker's fee**: I will require a speaker's fee of the same amount as the cost of your regular business oriented ticket, but 100â‚¬ excl. taxes at a minimum. I'll also expect to be provided with a complimentary ticket to your event.

4. **Travel & Accomodation**: I expect to be reimbursed for travel and accommodation[^1]. Plan for me to have at least one overnight stay (arriving either the day before your event or leaving the day after) as I cannot travel back and forth in one day and still be at my top presentation game. 

If all of these are agreeable, I'm happy to continue the conversation about me speaking at your event. If not, then I'm sorry but please understand that speaking at your event will not be possible for me.

If you have any questions about these requirements vs your event, then please get in touch, I'm happy to clarify.

[^1]: Travel: 2nd class high speed train within Germany, Economy class flight within continental Europe, Business class flight without. Travel to and from the venue to station/airport by taxi or public transport. Accomodation: Hotel directly at or at safe walking distance to the venue, min. three Hotelstars or equivalent, breakfast included.
