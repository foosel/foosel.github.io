Hi! So you are interested in me speaking at your event! Great!

Before we continue in clarifying my availability and hammering out the details by [email](mailto:gina@foosel.net), let me tell you about some minimal requirements I have for speaking engagements:

1. **Health guidelines**: I'm a signatory of the [Public Health Pledge](https://phpledge.com/) and have thus pledged to only speak at or otherwise participate in in-person events that have guidelines in place tailored towards limiting the spread of transmittable diseases like COVID-19 among their visitors. You can find suggestions on how to go about that for your event on the page of the Public Health Pledge.

2. **Code of Conduct**: I will only attend your event if you have a Code of Conduct in place and are able to enforce it.

3. **Speaker's fee**: I will require a speaker's fee of the same amount as the cost of your regular business oriented ticket, but 100â‚¬ excl. taxes at a minimum. I'll also expect to be provided with a complimentary ticket to your event.

4. **Travel & Accomodation**: I expect to be reimbursed for travel and accommodation[^1]. Plan for me to have at least one overnight stay (arriving either the day before your event or leaving the day after) as I cannot travel back and forth in one day and still be at my top presentation game. 

5. **Preparation**: I expect to receive any information required to give my talk (which room, virtual or otherwise, exact time to be present before/after agreed upon talk time, any kind of other necessary things like login data, upload folders, tech requirements to give my talk, presentation formats, slide theming, etc) until four weeks before the talk appointment.

6. **Technical requirements**: In case of in-person talks, I require a stage that allows me to connect my own presentation device via HDMI to a beamer or similar large presentation screen, at 1080p output. Please make sure I have space to move a bit and don't have to stay glued to the laptop (I'll bring a presentation remote myself). I expect a working mobile, ideally hands-free, microphone so I don't have to raise my voice to allow everyone to hear what I have to say.

If all of these are agreeable, I'm happy to continue the conversation about me speaking at your event. If not, then I'm sorry but please understand that speaking at your event will not be possible for me.

If you have any questions about these requirements vs your event, then please get in touch, I'm happy to clarify.
