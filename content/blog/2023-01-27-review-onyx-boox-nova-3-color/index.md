I've always been a bookworm. As a child, my favourite past time was reading.
I usually dragged my current book with me *everywhere* and would read at any
opportunity[^1]. So, when e-readers became a thing, I was very excited to
save on a ton of shelf space in the future and got myself an Amazon Kindle at the first
chance I got. Back then in 2010 I actually had to import my Kindle 3 Keyboard from the US since
it wasn't available in Germany yet. And since then I've gone through a 
couple of e-readers, all of them Kindles. But all the time I was a bit annoyed
at some things:

1. Vendor lock-in. Yes, you *can* send books from other sources than Amazon
   itself to your Kindle, can convert PDF and EPUB and whatnot, but in my
   experience it was always a bit of a hassle and especially in the case of
   PDFs a mess. Even with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) in my toolbelt, I didn't feel all too happy
   and most of the books I got through [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) and the like - which
   tended to be EPUB or PDF - stayed unread in my collection while I kept throwing money
   at Amazon.
2. Black and white only. That's still an issue with pretty much all e-readers
   out there, as color displays are only now slowly becoming a thing. But the lack of color
   means that things that very much profit from color, like coding related books (syntax highlighting),
   comics, RPG source books, etc. so far were something I had to read on my phone or tablet.

Then I came across [Scott Hanselman's post "The quiet rise of E Ink Tablets and Infinite Paper Note Takers - reMarkable 2 vs Onyx Boox Note Air
"](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/the-quiet-rise-of-e-ink-tablets-and-infinite-paper-note-takers-remarkable-2-vs-onyx-boox-note-air)
back in June of 2021, and immediately was intrigued. I had heard of the Remarkable 2 before, 
but decided against it due to yet another case of vendor lock-in. But through Scott's post I learned about 
Onyx' e-reader line-up. The fact that they run Android, have Google Play store integration and you can just 
install your own stuff on them out of the box was very much intriguing, and the Wacom digitizer was an additional 
point for that model range[^2]. And after persuing the Onyx website for a while, I decided to pull the trigger on a 
[Nova 3 Color](https://onyxboox.com/boox_nova3color) - the color e-ink intrigued me and the 7.8" size was right on the sweet spot.
I ordered it on June 14th 2021 directly from the Boox EU store, and it arrived on June 16th[^3]. All in all I paid 399â‚¬ for a 
bundle of the e-reader itself, a case, some screen protectors (that I don't use) and of course a stylus. Not too shabby.

So now, 1.5 years later, how do I like it? Let's find out!

## Color e-ink

To just address the elephant in the room right away: How does the color screen perform? Well, it's obviously
not something you can compare to a tablet OLED. The colors are way more muted and the contrast is not as high.
If you've ever seen a comic printed on newspaper paper, that's pretty much the same kind of color reproduction
you can expect here. But for what I got it for, it's absolutely fine. 

Syntax highlighting in code snippets is now visible beyond grayscale, and for comics and similar it also works.
Given, if I want to really enjoy the colors, I'm still getting a hold of my tablet, but for the use case of actually
reading long form books with the occasional code snippet, illustration, map or even short comic strip, it's absolutely
fine. And for highlighting text, it's also a great feature to have.

To give you an idea, I've attached a couple of pictures of the screen below. The first one is showing a code snippet in 
the PDF version of "Fluent Python 2nd edition", the second one is a page from the "Attack on Titan Anthology" and the 
third one shows a page from the rules PDF of the boardgame "Nemesis".

## Haptics

- tapping to turn pages, no dedicated buttons
- scroll areas on sides to change brightness, volume etc
- gestures for Home button and such
- plastic shell, not great, but feels solid enough
- case is very cheap, but functional, and thankfully looks nice

## Android apps

The fact that the Nova 3 Color runs Android is a huge plus for me. I've been using Android for years now (funnily enough as
long as I've been an e-reader owner: 2010), am therefore quite familiar with the ecosystem and hav also found 
apps that work for me.

The first thing I installed on the Nova was the official Kindle app. It's probably what I've used the most on the
device, and it works great. Until a recent update it sometimes crashed and I had to restart it (sometimes twice or
thrice before it worked) and scroll to the last page I was on, but with the last OS update I installed, 2022-11-24, this has
so far not happened again. In any case it wasn't something that happened on a daily basis, more like once or twice
per month.

The second app I installed was [ReadEra Premium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.readera.premium). I
tested many PDF/EPUB readers throughout the years, and currently that is the one that works best for me. On top of
PDF and EPUB it also supports CBR/CBZ, which is commonly used for comics, and a whole bunch of other formats. On the Nova,
I had to fiddle around a bit with the settings and ....

I have my book collection stored in my Google Drive, and so I installed DriveSync to be able to keep it in sync with
that and mirrored on the device. So far, every time that I've opened up the Nova to check out a new book I had just
pushed into Drive earlier, it was usually already there, so that works well too.

## Note taking

- used it for note taking for a while
- built-in app only
  - problem with anything 3rd part: not optimized for the e-ink screen
  - so bog slow
- ok for quick notes, but frankly for anything more the screen and thus writing space
  turned out to be way too small (albeit great as an e-reader!)
- have switched back to the tablet (which on the other hand is too big for reading)

## Conclusion

- would I buy it again?
  - yes, as an e-reader
  - for note taking I'd rather go with a 10" model

[^1]: Just not in the car thanks to this day suffering from severe motion 
sickness *sigh*. I very much envy people who can read in the car.
[^2]: My tablet - a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 that I use for handwritten note taking - has a Wacom digitizer, as does my Wacom Intuous S writing tablet. I've found the
range of third party stylus options quite amazing, and as a Lamy AL-star fan am the proud owner of both a 
[Lamy AL-star EMR stylus](https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-al-star/) and a [Staedtler Noris Digital Jumbo](https://www.staedtler.com/intl/en/discover/noris-digital/).
[^3]: This probably even includes a short delay due to a mail exchange on June 15th - it turns out they couldn't handle the umlauts in my name and needed something ASCII only
for the shipping label ðŸ˜¬
