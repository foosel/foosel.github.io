Two years ago I was into learning [React](https://reactjs.org/), since that is what I'm planning to use for a future
OctoPrint UI. And when I decided to reboot this webpage, I also figured I would use that
as a reason for experimenting with new build tools and techstacks. So I built this site
with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and a bunch of other stuff, and spent a lot
of time implementing basic content management tooling and rendering.

However, once that was done, I realized that while I had learned a lot about React and next.js
in the process, I had not really created something that is fun to use, which reflected in my 
reluctance to actually use it. Writing the post about [my custom SteamDeck buttons](/blog/2023-01-19-custom-steamdeck-buttons/),
yesterday really drove that point home again, and in fact kinda broke the camel's back for good ðŸ˜… 

So I decided to do what I'd been meaning to do for a long time and finally took a look at [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), 
which I had seen used a lot by others for their blogs over the past years, and also its 
[PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) that I had seen on [JÃ¼rgen Gmach's website](https://jugmac00.github.io/) (ðŸ‘‹).

Color me extremely surprised when I had my page rebuilt within a couple of hours, with all the features I wanted and more, and a way nicer
experience for me as the content creator. I didn't even have to touch my posts that much, mostly some small changes on the frontmatter and boom, done.

So I went down the rabbit hole further, fine tuned some things, customized some others, and now I'm really happy with the result.

And thus, please say hello to a new version `foosel.net`, now powered by Hugo and PaperMod.
