As the operator of this website I take the protection of your personal data very seriously. I treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information I collect and what I use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.

## 3. Data collection on `foosel.net`

### Server log files

The web server automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to my server in "server log files". These are:

-   Browser type and browser version
-   Operating system used
-   Referrer URL
-   Time of the server request
-   IP address

These log files are used for security measures and are deleted after 30 days.

These data will not be combined with data from other sources.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

### Plausible Analytics

I use the open source tool [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), self-hosted on `plausible.foosel.net`, to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in my website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected.

Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. You can see full details in [Plausible's data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

## 4. Plugins and tools

### YouTube

My website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.

If you visit one of the pages featuring a YouTube plugin and click on the preview, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of the pages you have visited.

If you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

YouTube is used to help make the website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under [https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy](https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy).
